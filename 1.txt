                  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

Abstract

   This document specifies the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).  TCP
   is an important transport-layer protocol in the Internet protocol
   stack, and it has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth
   of the Internet.  Over this time, a number of changes have been made
   to TCP as it was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been
   documented in a piecemeal fashion.  This document collects and brings
   those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793.
   This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093,
   6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793.  It updates RFCs
   1011 and 1122, and it should be considered as a replacement for the
   portions of those documents dealing with TCP requirements.  It also
   updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling
   while in the SYN-RECEIVED state.  The TCP header control bits from
   RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168.
